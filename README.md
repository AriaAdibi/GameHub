# Game Hub

This is a *java* project implementing a client-server model where games can be loaded and people can join and play the game. The game [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) is also implemented as an example game that can be executed in this model. One of the focuses of the project is the correct handling of the multiuser access and interactions.

The [*GameHub.wmv*](./GameHub.wmv) file shows all the features and how the program should be run.
